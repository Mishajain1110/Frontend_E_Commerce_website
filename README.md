# Frontend Task

This is Question 1 of the frontend project: "Front-end for a Product Details Page" for the induction in the Software Development division of the Programming Club at IIT Indore. The task involves using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a basic website with some simple Javascript features. I referred to various sources on YouTube for effects such as text animation, dark/light mode, and implemented them in this project. I used images from Google as a reference to implement them in the code.
