# Frontend Task

This task was provided by my college club at IIT Indore, for web development involving creating a basic website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with incorporating some simple JavaScript features. To complete this project, I referred to various sources on YouTube to gain knowledge about different effects and then implemented them in the website's code. I used images from Google as references to help me with the implementation process.
